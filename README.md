## Overview
The purpose for this project is to make an easy to use and fully customizable open-source satellite position visualization tool. There are industry standard products available for professionals who work in the satellite industry. The intention of this project is to create something for those interested parties who, for whatever reason, want an alternative. However, please keep in mind, a corner stone of this project is [Cesium](https://cesium.com). Cesium is now it's own company but started as a team effort of professionals from [AGI](https://www.agi.com). AGI produced and industry standard product know as [STK](https://www.agi.com/products/stk). STK now stands for *Systems Tool Kit* but was previously known as **Satellite Tool Kit**.
